# Jekyll Blog Demo
> A minimal static site blog based on a Jekyll sample

This repo was created using a base template generated by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) as such:

```bash
$ jekyll new jekyll-blog-demo
```


## Setup and Run

This project was setup to run both locally and on Github Pages.

For instructions on how to setup and run this project locally, see my [gist](https://gist.github.com/MichaelCurrin/1085ab164550b31272699920b5549d4b).

Since this is a _Project Page_ and not a _User Page_, the assets are relative to the root domain by default and that gives `404` errors. Therefore the empty `baseurl` in [config file](_config.yml) had to be replaced with a value.


## Gems
