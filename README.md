# Jekyll Blog Demo
> Demo to show off a minimal Jekyll blog using Github Pages

This repo was created using Jekyll's base template for a blog.

```bash
$ jekyll new jekyll-blog-demo
```

It uses the `minima` theme.

Since this is a Project Page and not a User page, the assets are relative to the root domain by default and that gives `404` errors. Therefore the empty `baseurl` in [config file](_config.yml) had to be replaced with a value.

To get started making your own static site, head to the [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) or [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) sites.
