The Markdown name plays on the "markup" part of the HTML acronym.

You need a markdown converter to turn markdown into HTML. Many IDEs, static site generators and websites (like GitHub) support writing in markdown. There are other stands too like Asciidoc and RST.

> The Markdown Guide is a free and open-source reference guide that explains how to use Markdown, the simple and easy-to-use markup language you can use to format virtually any document.

Or read more on [Wikipedia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown).

> Markdown is a lightweight markup language for creating formatted text using a plain-text editor. 

I also have a [Markdown cheatsheet](https://michaelcurrin.github.io/dev-cheatsheets/cheatsheets/markdown/) collection if you need to brush up on the syntax or want to learn something new.
